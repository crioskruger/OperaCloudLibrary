Reservations are a central feature of OPERA Cloud. As a key source of information, the reservation\\_specifies a guest's arrival date, departure date, room type, rate, packages, and many other details. It is also a gateway to dozens of other functions that contribute to the guest's experience.\\_ All reservations in OPERA Cloud require a guest profile.  <br /><br /> You can create profiles while booking a reservation. If a profile already exists, you can look it up (using getProfiles in CRM module) and attach it to the reservation during the reservation booking process using the Profile ID.<br /><br />Compatible with OPERA Cloud release 21.5.0.0.<br /><br /><p>This document and all content within is available under the Universal Permissive License v 1.0 (https://oss.oracle.com/licenses/upl).
